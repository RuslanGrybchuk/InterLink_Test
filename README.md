# InterLink_Test
An assignment for InterLink Lviv inCamp

The program works fine and picks students with knowledge level above average into the list of intern students in the Internship class.

internship.getStudents() prints the mentioned list out.

The solution can be easily improved by adding a proper implementation to the getStudents method in the Application class, 
this will allow to add students from a file or a database.
